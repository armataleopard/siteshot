PROJECT: SiteShot $404 – Memecoin Website

GOAL:
Create a high-end, interactive and animated website for the memecoin "SiteShot $404", themed around system crashes, digital errors, and nostalgic software failures. The site should have a distinct aesthetic based on glitch art, broken UIs, corrupted Win95-style prompts, and surreal internet nostalgia.

GENERAL DESIGN:
- Visual style: glitchy, broken OS interfaces, old-school system UI popups (Win98, XP), neon & CRT scanlines, corrupted graphs
- Dark theme with deep blues, digital reds, flickering screen effects
- Logo and main header (centered): “SiteShot $404”
- Subtitle: “When you bought the top… and the top crashed”
- Add a “Launch on PUMP.FUN” section on homepage with visible date: “LAUNCHING PUMPFUN 30 MAY”
- Use the supplied image set as visual references for aesthetics and animations
- Fully responsive design

NAVIGATION:
- Home
- The Error (about section)
- Artifacts (gallery)
- Terminal Logs (lore and meme logs)
- Join Us (Telegram only)

ANIMATIONS:
- Static noise/flickering background loop
- Hover effect that triggers “404” glitch sparks on elements
- Popup elements styled like crash error dialogs that fade in/out with sounds
- Rolling ticker with fake market crashes and bugged out memos
- Mouse trail that leaves pixel distortions
- Opening transition like BIOS boot glitching into website
- Hovering over charts randomly distorts them

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
1. “Generate Fake Error” – button that spawns an error popup with randomized glitch text
2. “Crash Simulator” – drag slider to crash site UI (goes black, reboot bootloader, fake fix)
3. “Museum of Memes” – gallery of fake financial art pieces with trading candles drawn in oil-paint style
4. AI bot chat window – speaks glitchy fortunes using error codes
5. Graphs that corrupt the more you interact – eventually replace candles with burning candles

CONTENT BLOCKS:
1. Error Manifesto
   - ~130+ words fictional backstory: the coin was born from the depths of a failed trade and grew stronger with every rug.
   - Example: “They tried to banish it. They tried to fix it. But $404 was never a bug—it was the system. When the bots failed and the candles melted, a lone trader screen-captured history and turned the screenshot into prophecy…”

2. Memetic Logs
   - Feed of broken screenshots with captioned memes.
   - Include user-submitted crash logs in gallery format.

3. About $404 Tokenomics
   - Supply: 404,000,000
   - No LP locked. No roadmap. Only RAM left.
   - Tax: 4.04% in/out
   - Glitch-based redistribution (fake concept)

4. “Join the Loop”
   - Button to open Telegram group
   - Fake CLI that types “ping telegram && open portal”

FOOTER:
- Minimalistic, black background with CRT flicker
- Only Telegram icon + address
- Text: “System halted. Reload to pretend again.”

DELIVERABLES:
- HTML/CSS/JS site for Cursor
- All visuals must be pixel-perfect and resemble provided imagery
- All animations need to be performance-optimized
